# Basic commands
- Git creates a .git directory and tracks the changes in the working directory (and subtree).
	- To create a .git/ folder:
		$ git init

	- Make a file in the working directory: 
		$ cat > newFile

		- Type some text, press return and Ctrl+D to exit (and save).
		- Alternative:
			$ touch newFile

	- Track the changes in the working directory:
		$ git status
		- This command shows the status of the files, untracked, staged.
			+ _untracked_ is the stage after the commit.
			+ _staged_ is the stage before you are ready to commit.

	- Add files to the staged step:
		$ git add . # to add all the files
		$ git add newFile # to add only newFile
		- Now the files are ready-to-commit.
			+ Retype: $ git status # to see the difference
	
	- Commit files:
		$ git commit -m newFile # commits only <newFile>
